# kube-disruptions
Welcome to kube-disruptions, a repository dedicated to exploring disruptions in Kubernetes clusters and practicing handling them.

Kubernetes is a powerful container orchestration system that can automate deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications. However, even with the best configuration and setup, things can still go wrong. Nodes can fail, pods can crash, networks can become unreliable, and many other issues can arise. Kubernetes provides various mechanisms for dealing with disruptions, but they require planning, testing, and continuous improvement.

This repository contains a collection of topics and exercises related to Kubernetes Disruptions, with the goal of helping you develop skills and confidence in handling them. The topics cover various aspects of disruptions, such as:

Understanding failure modes and resilience
Planning for disruptions with readiness and liveness probes, replication controllers, and other mechanisms
Detecting and diagnosing disruptions with logs, events, and metrics
Recovering from disruptions with self-healing, rolling updates, and other strategies
Testing and simulating disruptions with tools like Chaos Monkey, Litmus, and others
The exercises provide hands-on experience with Kubernetes Disruptions, using scenarios and simulations that simulate real-world situations. You can use these exercises to practice your skills and test your knowledge in a safe and controlled environment.

Whether you are a Kubernetes beginner or an experienced user, this repository can help you enhance your skills and be more confident in handling disruptions. We encourage you to explore the topics and exercises, contribute your own ideas and solutions, and share your feedback with the community.

Let's dive into the world of Kubernetes Disruptions and make our clusters more resilient!
