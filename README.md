# kube-disruptions
Welcome to kube-disruptions, a repository dedicated to exploring disruptions in Kubernetes clusters and practicing handling them.

Kubernetes is a powerful container orchestration system that can automate deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications. However, even with the best configuration and setup, things can still go wrong. Nodes can fail, pods can crash, networks can become unreliable, and many other issues can arise. Kubernetes provides various mechanisms for dealing with disruptions, but they require planning, testing, and continuous improvement.

#### Two types of events that can cause downtime or other disruptions in a Kubernetes cluster:

**Voluntary disruptions:** These are disruptions that are initiated intentionally by an operator or administrator, often for the purpose of performing maintenance, upgrades, or other tasks. For example, a voluntary disruption may involve draining a node or a pod to perform maintenance or updating the software version of a deployment. Kubernetes provides mechanisms for performing voluntary disruptions in a controlled and orchestrated manner, such as using rolling updates or node draining to ensure that the workload is redistributed and the impact on users is minimized.

**Involuntary disruptions:** These are disruptions that occur unexpectedly or unintentionally, often due to hardware or software failures, network issues, or other unforeseen circumstances. For example, an involuntary disruption may involve a node crashing, a pod being evicted due to resource constraints, or a network partition causing communication failures between components. Kubernetes also provides mechanisms for handling involuntary disruptions, such as pod rescheduling, automatic node recovery, and automatic failover for stateful workloads.

This repository contains a collection of topics and exercises related to Kubernetes Disruptions, with the goal of helping you develop skills and confidence in handling them. The topics cover various aspects of disruptions, such as:

- Understanding failure modes and resilience
- Planning for disruptions with readiness and liveness probes, replication controllers, and other mechanisms
- Detecting and diagnosing disruptions with logs, events, and metrics
- Recovering from disruptions with self-healing, rolling updates, and other strategies
- Testing and simulating disruptions with tools like Chaos Monkey, Litmus, and others

The exercises provide hands-on experience with Kubernetes Disruptions, using scenarios and simulations that simulate real-world situations. You can use these exercises to practice your skills and test your knowledge in a safe and controlled environment.

Whether you are a Kubernetes beginner or an experienced user, this repository can help you enhance your skills and be more confident in handling disruptions. We encourage you to explore the topics and exercises, contribute your own ideas and solutions, and share your feedback with the community.

Let's dive into the world of Kubernetes Disruptions and make our clusters more resilient!
